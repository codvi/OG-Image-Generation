Problem Statement
Objective: Create a static post page using React that dynamically generates an Open Graph (og
) based on the post content.
Post Page: Design a simple post page where users can input a title, content, and optionally an image.
OG Image Generation: Develop a system to dynamically generate an og
(1200x630 pixels) that includes the post title, a snippet of the content, and any associated image, replicating the design of the post itself.
Integration: Ensure the generated og
is accessible via a URL and automatically add the og
meta tag to the post page's HTML.
Styling: Make the og
visually appealing, readable, and include branding elements.
Performance: Optimize the image generation process for speed and efficiency.
**Tech Stack and Libraries Used
*Frontend
React: For building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the React components.
*Backend
Node.js: For server-side development.
Express.js: For handling API requests.
canvas: For generating the og
dynamically.

Additional Tools
Axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.
This setup provides a robust environment for developing and deploying a dynamic post page with automatic OG image generation.
